take log line

 	- Match and replace common regexps
 		- syslog datetime
 		- ip address

	- Sort the content into a new file


pass each line in new file to each cluster group
	- cluster group breaks down the line and tries to match it to its own clusters
	- if it doesn't match any existing cluster group, create a new group
 
 spit out each cluster group as some samples, and a regexp
 
 
 Cluster Group()
 		
 	- Split the logline up into delimited cells
 		- record the delimiter
	- Recurse around, using common delimiters
	 	' - ' 
	 	':'
	 	' : ' 
	 - Make each delimeter its own cluster too
	 
	- linked lists? by number of children, parents?
	
	- count the number of nodes at each level
		- nodes with only one value are fixed
		- nodes with more than one value are variables
		- work on multipositioned stuff later?
	- list of lists?
