Clearcutter is a tool for general log analysis, with the aim of automating many of the processes that have
traditionally been done manually by security analysts handling unfamiliar log files.

Presently it supports four major modes of operation (two of which are specific to Alienvault OSSIM)

Identify - Locate 'unique' log messages within a log sample. By unique here, we mean the actual log message itself,
regardless of the variable content. E.G. the log message "User admin logged into host gateway" is a unique log entry, 
where the text 'admin' and 'gateway' are variable content, but the unique log message is "user <user> logged into host <host>"
Identifying the specific log messages present in a log file is a key first step to further log processsing.

Sequence - The variable fields identified in the specific event messages are what identify sequences of logs that 
identify specific behavioral actions. These sequences of actions are key to contexting logs into forensic nodes.
Eg. the sequence
	- <PID> Connection from host <IP>
	- <PID> Valid Key Exchange from host <IP>
	- <PID> User <user> is valid
	- <PID> user <user> authenticated successfully
	- <PID> new session <sessionID> started for user <user>
	- <PID> session <sessionID> disconnected

can be expressed as "Login session from user <user> from host <host>" (with an accompanyying begin and end time)
